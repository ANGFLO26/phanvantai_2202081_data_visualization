# User Conversion Funnel Analysis

## A. Introduction

This project analyzes user behavior using a **Funnel Chart**. By tracking the number of users at each stage and calculating drop-off rates, this analysis helps identify where users abandon the process, allowing for optimization.

## B. Process

- Load and read user interaction data from a CSV file.
- Count the number of users at each stage.
- Sort stages based on user count.
- Calculate drop-off rates between stages.
- Visualize data using an interactive funnel chart.

## C. System Requirements

- Operating System: Windows, Linux, macOS
- Python 3.8+

## D. Installation

Ensure Python is installed, then install the required libraries:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## E. Usage Instructions

1. Place the `user_data.csv` file in the `data` directory.
2. Run the script using the command:
   ```sh
   python hw_plot.ipynb
   ```
3. The output will include:
   - The total number of users at each stage.
   - Drop-off rates between stages.
   - An interactive funnel chart visualizing the user journey.
