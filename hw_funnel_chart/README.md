## B. Process

- Analyze the number of users at each stage: `homepage`, `product_page`, `cart`, `checkout`, `purchase`.
- Calculate conversion rates between stages.
- Display an interactive funnel chart.
- Support reading data from a CSV file.

## C. System Requirements

- Operating System: Windows, Linux, macOS
- Python 3.8+

## D. Installation

Install the required libraries:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## E. Usage Instructions

1. Place the " user_data.csv " file inside the data folder.
2. Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
   ```sh
   python hw_plot.ipynb
   ```
3. The output will display:
   - Total number of users at each stage.
