1. Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset to discover patterns, relationships, and insights about students' academic performance based on demographic and social factors.

2. Dataset Description
- File: StudentsPerformance.csv
- Description: The dataset contains information about students' gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and scores in math, reading, and writing.
- Main columns:
  - gender
  - race/ethnicity
  - parental level of education
  - lunch
  - math score
  - reading score
  - writing score

3. Project Requirements

3.1. Data Analysis
- Overview of the dataset structure and basic statistics.
- Analyze learning outcomes: descriptive statistics, score distributions, and correlations between subjects.
- Analyze by gender: compare average scores, score distributions, and group performance by gender.
- Analyze by parental level of education: compare average scores and score distributions by parental education level.
- Analyze by lunch type: compare average scores and score distributions by lunch type.
- Analyze by race/ethnicity: compare average scores and score distributions by race/ethnicity.

3.2. Data Visualization
- Use bar plots to compare average scores across groups.
- Use boxplots and violin plots to show score distributions.
- Use heatmaps to visualize correlations between subjects.
- Use scatter plots to explore relationships between different scores.
- Ensure all visualizations are clear, labeled, and support the analysis objectives.
