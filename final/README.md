# Data Visualization Project

**Student:** Phan Van Tai  
**ID:** 2202081

## Overview
This project analyzes the "StudentsPerformance.csv" dataset using Python. The main goal is to explore and visualize the relationships between students' academic performance and various demographic and social factors.

## Dataset
- **File:** StudentsPerformance.csv
- **Description:** Contains information about students' gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

## Analysis Topics
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Overview of the dataset structure and basic statistics.
2. **Learning Outcomes**
   - Descriptive statistics, score distributions, and correlations between subjects.
3. **Analysis by Gender**
   - Compare average scores, score distributions, and group performance by gender.
4. **Analysis by Parental Level of Education**
   - Compare average scores and score distributions by parental education level.
5. **Analysis by Lunch Type**
   - Compare average scores and score distributions by lunch type.
6. **Analysis by Race/Ethnicity**
   - Compare average scores, participation rates, and score distributions by race/ethnicity.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open `final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for the list of required Python packages.

## Notes
- All visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn.
- The analysis is structured for clarity and reproducibility.

## Conclusion
This analysis of the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset reveals several important insights:
- There are clear differences in academic performance based on gender, parental education level, lunch type, and race/ethnicity.
- Students with standard lunch, higher parental education, and certain demographic backgrounds tend to achieve higher scores.
- Gender differences are notable, especially in reading and writing scores.
- Data visualization techniques such as bar plots, boxplots, and heatmaps help to clearly illustrate these patterns and relationships.

These findings can help us better understand the factors that influence student achievement and design more effective support strategies.
